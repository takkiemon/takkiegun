You are Space Pilot Hoshi.
After failing to retrieve a star from the Red Nova Pirates, 
your spaceship got captured in a giant holding cell. 
They're trying to crack open your ship like a walnut and then torture you until 
you tell them where the Prince is. 
Your tolerance for pain is extremely low and the Prince is your best friend, 
so don't let them get to you!
